# Vim configuration (vimrc)

This file contains my vim configuration setup.

To use, checkout and then from the repository directory:

    ln -s $(pwd)/vimrc ${HOME}/.vimrc
    ln -s $(pwd)/vim ${HOME}/.vim

This configuration uses vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), so to
begin you'll need to install the plugins by running (from within Vim):

    :PlugInstall

That should be everything.
